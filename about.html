            <p>Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998-December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. His 2018 single "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform Spotify over one billion times and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. "Lucid Dreams", along with his earlier hit single "All Girls Are the Same", helped him secure a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. He derived his stage name from late American rapper Tupac Shakur's role in the film Juice and stated that it represents taking over the world.[4] He is considered as a leading figure in the emo-rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-late 2010s.</p>
            <p>"All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were two of five singles included on Higgins' debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical reception, and contained three other singles: "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Hot 100.</p>
